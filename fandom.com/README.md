# Minimal fandom.com

Fandom.com seems a little bit crowded, so this is an opinionated script which tries to simplify the user experience as much as possible.

Simplifies all the wiki sites of fandom.com as follows:

 * the header is more compact and is always pinned
 * the navbar on the left has been removed
 * the sidebar on the right has been removed
 * the two footers have also been completely removed
 * the content is expanded by default
 * the side buttons to the left of the page have been simplified
